# Checkmk extension for Certbot LetsEncrypt Certificate monitoring

Based on this [Checkmk Template](https://github.com/jiuka/checkmk_template)

## Development

For the best development experience use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension. This maps your workspace into a checkmk docker container giving you access to the python environment and libraries the installed extension has.

## Continuous integration
### Local

To build the package hit `Crtl`+`Shift`+`B` to execute the build task in VSCode.

`pytest` can be executed from the terminal or the test ui.

### Github Workflow

The provided Github Workflows run `flake8` in the same checkmk docker conatiner as vscode.
